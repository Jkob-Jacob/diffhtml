# <Â±/> diffHTML

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/diffhtml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tbranyen/diffhtml)
[![Coverage
  Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/tbranyen/diffhtml/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/tbranyen/diffhtml?branch=master)

Latest version: 1.0.0-beta.17

At its core, diffHTML is an extremely lightweight and optimized HTML parser and
Virtual DOM specifically designed for modern web UIs. These interfaces can be
applications, games, data visualizations, or anything else that you may want to
render in a web browser or Node.

This repository is a mono-repo structured with the [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
CLI tool. This makes it easier to support continuous integration, consistent
versioning, and working on the various diffHTML tools.

## Features

- Parses real **HTML** and supports **JSX & Tagged Templates**.
- Memory efficient VDOM rendering that utilizes **object pooling**.
- **Transitions** for animations and hooking into DOM changes.
- Powerful **middleware** extends diffHTML with additional features.
- **Web** and **React**-compatible stateful components.
- View and debug your code using the **Chrome DevTools extension**.

## Packages

The following list of packages are nested in the `/packages` folder. They can
be tested globally or independently by using `npm test` at the root directory
level or any specific nested package level.

* **[diffhtml](/packages/diffhtml)**

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml
  ```

  The core library for creating user interfaces. Contains a full build and
  smaller runtime build (which excludes HTML parser, tagged templates, and
  performance metrics).

* **[diffhtml-components](/packages/diffhtml-components)**

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-components
  ```

  Provides stateful React-like and v1 Web Component classes with a consistent
  API. If you're looking for drop-in React parity, refer to the
  [diffhtml-react-compat](/packages/diffhtml-react-compat) package.

* **[diffhtml-render-to-string](/packages/diffhtml-render-to-string)**

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-render-to-string
  ```

  Use with diffHTML to render your complex markup to strings. This is useful
  for server-side rendering, testing, and HTML/XML transformations.

* **[babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml](/packages/babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml)**

  ``` sh
  npm install babel-plugin-transform-diffhtml
  ```
  Converts markup into function calls. Similar to how JSX compiles down to
  `React.createElement`, this module converts HTML elements to function calls.
  This is useful for optimizing file size and CPU time by pushing parsing to
  the compiler.

* [diffhtml-middleware-logger](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-logger)

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-logger
  ```

  Logs out diffHTML state from the start and end of every render transaction.

* [diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events)

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-synthetic-events
  ```

  Changes the event binding from inline event handlers like `onclick = fn` to
  use `addEventListener`. Events are attached to the `body` element and
  coordinated to children through delegation.

* [diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions)

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-inline-transitions
  ```

  By default diffHTML provides transition hooks at a global level. This
  middleware turns them into scoped, performant, event hooks.

* [diffhtml-middleware-verify-state](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-verify-state)

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-verify-state
  ```

  Asserts that a render properly updated the old Virtual Tree and the DOM. Will
  recursively search for inconsistencies, displays warnings unless debugging is
  enabled, then it throws errors instead.

* [diffhtml-middleware-service-worker](/packages/diffhtml-middleware-service-worker)

  ``` sh
  npm install diffhtml-middleware-service-worker
  ```

  Helps with the creation of a service worker for PWAs, available as a
  convenience to make development more friendlier.

* [diffhtml-react-compat](/packages/diffhtml-react-compat)

  ```
  npm install diffhtml-react-compat
  ```

  **Highly Experimental:** This is a compatibility package meant to be a
  drop-in replacement for the modules: `react` and `react-dom`. It wraps the
  [diffHTML Components](/packages/diffhtml-components) package as the base for
  the component constructors. It then layers additional React-specific APIs.

* [diffhtml-static-sync](/packages/diffhtml-static-sync)

  ```
  npm install diffhtml-static-sync
  ```

  **Highly Experimental:** A work-in-progress static HTML server that automatically
  reloads your markup as you save using Web Sockets.

* [diffhtml-devtools](/packages/diffhtml-devtools)

  Chrome Extension providing DevTools for inspecting and learning more about
  your running diffHTML code. Currently logs information about transactions,
  allows toggling active middleware, and displays some memory internals.

* [diffhtml-website](/packages/diffhtml-website)

  The source for the [www.diffhtml.org](https://www.diffhtml.org) website.
